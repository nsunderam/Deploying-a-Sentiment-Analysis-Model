# Deploying-a-Sentiment-Analysis-Model
Final project for the Udacity Deep Learning NanoDegree

The notebook and Python files provided here, once completed, result in a simple web app which interacts with a deployed recurrent neural network performing sentiment analysis on movie reviews.

The end result is a simple web page which a user can use to enter a movie review. The web page will then send the review off to our deployed model which will predict the sentiment of the entered review.
